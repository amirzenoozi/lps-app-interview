## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

- ``` cd lps-app-interview ```
- ``` git config core.hooksPath .githooks ```

## Other Available Scripts

1. For Test: `yarn run test`
2. For Build: `yarn run build`
3. For Manual Setting: `yarn run eject`

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
